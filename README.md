# Lights-Out

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

Extract lights-out.tar from lights-out.tar.gz. Then extract the files from lights-out.tar.  
As this is a bare repository, run "git clone lights-out [folder name]", where the folder name can be anything of choice.  
After entering the app directory, run "npm install" to install the modules used by the app.

## To Run App

In the project directory, you can run the file using "npm start".   
Once it starts up, you may access the app at localhost:3000 (it may be automatically opened in your internet browser).  
Black squares are "off" and white squares on "on".  The game ends when all squares/lights are shut off.  
A button is available to immediately clear the board and win the game, as it is said that there are some initial states that cannot be solved.

## `Run Tests

Basic tests can be performed on the components using "npm test a".
